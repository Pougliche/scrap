Hello there ! You are a bold one !

You're about to get the current price of every crypto-currency on the market through a neat little ruby program !

A second program will shine a holy light into your life as the names and zipcode of every city from Val d'Oise will appear on your screen. As a bonus, you'll also get the email adress of the town's cityhall, so feel free to send them a message shaming their probably awful name.

Congratulations, you are strong and wise, and I'm very proud of you. 

Don't forget to rspec our spec and may the force be with you.
